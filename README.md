Check out the site: https://evan-sackmann.github.io/e-commerce/

This is a design from FrontEnd Mentor which I implemented with React. 

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
